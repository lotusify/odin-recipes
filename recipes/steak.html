        <h1> Flat Iron Steak </h1>
        <p> What Is Flat Iron Steak?
            Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.

            Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.

        <h1> Ingredients </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h1> Steps </h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li> Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place steak in the hot skillet and discard any remaining marinade; sear and cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li> Allow steak to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
